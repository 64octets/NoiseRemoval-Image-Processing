# Image Processing - Noise Removal

Images taken with both digital cameras and conventional film cameras will pick up noise from a variety of sources. Further use of these images will often require that the noise be (partially) removed â€“ for aesthetic purposes as in artistic work or marketing, or for practical purposes such as computer vision.<br>
